# C++ Game

> Note:
    This is a *work in progress* and I haven't yet finished watching the tutorial.

This small project follows the footsteps of [Let's make games' "How to make a
game"
tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQzAHcojEKg&list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx),
as a means of learning a little bit of C++. The idea is **not**
to stick to the tutorial, but to give my own touches along the
way. For a repository exactly as the tutorial's, see [the tutorial's
repository](https://github.com/carlbirch/BirchEngine).

The game is 2D and has an "8-bit" style. The assets in this
repository are original and were made in
[Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

I try to extensively document (comment) what I learn along the way in this repository.

### Libraries/Requirements

The [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/) is used, as stated in
the tutorial. I could not install SDL2-image. So, differently
from the tutorial, I do not use it here.

The Makefile used for compilation in VSCode is provided.
