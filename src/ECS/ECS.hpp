    The "inline" keyword here is an optimization. Since this
    function is small and will be called often, using "inline"
    will actually write down the function instructions as if
    they were written directly in the code where the function
    is called. This optimizes code at runtime.
    
    The fact that we define lastID as a static variable
    makes it so that each time we call the function, the
    previous value it had is kept. So, it is initialized at
    zero and, since we have lastID++, it increments by one
    each time the function is called. It will become clear why
    this is useful in the next definition in this source code
    (template <typename T> inline ComponentID
    getComponentTypeID() noexcept).

    The template creates a blueprint.
    
    Here, the template would replace "T" for the type
    specified when calling the function. We can see that T
    isn't used anywhere.
    Basically, when a new Component is created, we'll generate
    an unique ID for it by calling this function and passing
    the component class as T. As such:
    ID = getComponentTypeID<ComponentClass>().
    C++ understands that this function is different from the
    previous because we pass the template type T, had we not
    specified it, C++ would understand we're calling the
    previous function.
    
    By defining the static variable typeID here, typeID will
    be remembered everytime this function is called for the
    same T type. It is initialized as getComponentTypeID()
    (the previous function, in this case). This means that,
    everytime we instantiate a NEW type T and call
    getComponentTypeID<T>(), we'll set T's typeID as the
    lastID defined in getComponentTypeID(). Because typeID is
    not changed inside this template, everytime we call
    getComponentTypeID<T>(), we'll get the same typeID (it is
    only initialized as lastID the first time!). This means
    that each component is associated to exactly one typeID,
    and that each component class has a unique ID because
    everytime getComponentTypeID() is called it generates a
    new ID. 
    
    This seems like an overly complicated way of doing this,
    but it most definitely guarantees that we'll not mess up
    the ID of component classes by hardcoding them.

        In the next lines we have "...", when looking at this
        website: "https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_parameters"
        at "Non-type template parameter" number 3, we see it
        relates to "parameter packs". It links us to this link:
        https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack,
        which says: "A template parameter pack is a template
        parameter that accepts zero or more template arguments
        (non-types, types, or templates). A function parameter
        pack is a function parameter that accepts zero or more
        function arguments."

        This means that the first template argument, T, is
        mandatory and is a class, but that the template may
        receive extra, optional arguments. Here, these arguments
        are called Targs, and because of the preceeding
        "typename" keyword, they must be classes. It seems to me
        that "... Targs" serves a similar purpose to python's
        "*args" in a function input.

        So we can pass something like addComponent<T, TArg1,
        TArg2>.
        
        T will define the class of the method's return value, and
        it will be a reference (because of the ampersand); while
        Targs will define the types of the functions actual
        inputs mArgs. A call would look like:

        addComponent<T, Targ1, Targ2>(Targ1&& mArg1, Targ2&& mArg2);
        
        For example, say we want to add Component "POSITION" to the
        entity, and that to initialize it we'll need arguments
        x, y of types int. We'll call:
        entity.addComponent<POSITION, int, int>(x, y).
        We can see it since in the very first line we define a T*
        pointer called c, taking mArgs as input to create the T instance.
