Collision class
===============

This class groups functions for handling collision. The use of a class seems unnecessary, and might
be reviewed later. This could potentially be implemented directly inside of Game.hpp and Game.cpp, 
but this modularity seems nevertheless positive.

.. note::
    Improve Collision::handle_collisions docstring.
